# Disclaimer:

- This was originally a demo project made for an interview, but since I have invested a decent amount of time on it and it has grown quite nicely I have decided to continue with it further (and also take on a bigger risk).

- I am no artist. Most if not all images used are taken from game rips and are probably subjected to copyright laws (not a law student either but I am sure it is bad). Most assets are taken from Touhou 7 and 8, and if ZUN somehow stumbles upon this place and wishes for me to take it down I will do so without complaints.

- I have yet to decide on a "gimmick" for this game yet and have decided to only implement the core features of any shoot-em-up games, being shooting and being shot at by patterns. If something seems lackluster, it is likely because I haven't made up my mind yet, not that I am incapable of implementing it.

# Features:

- Multiple characters, shots and bombs to choose from (only characters are selectable at the point of writing as proof of concept, since shots and bombs selection are similar if not identical and I am not sure if I want there to be shop/inventory system I have decided to not make them selectable just yet).

- Pattern scripts inspired from Danmakufu syntax (a whooping of 11 patterns at the moment /s).

- Half decent-ish graphics and animations for things... I am no UI/UX designer so...

# Release

- Currently I'm checking out ECS as a potential way to improve performance so progress is likely slowed down.
- The last non-ECS build is uploaded [here](https://mega.nz/file/USxikayZ#KNEKXxsV3mLrFuik_dY1L3WCzt-DLkfCKgs7F1LbRJc).
- Latest release can be found [here](https://mega.nz/file/JbR1TAAb#wiCz1j0mDemGK9bHj1sUXS86vBpUTMAGv44r0CnSTbg)
